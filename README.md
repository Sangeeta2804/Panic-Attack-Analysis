# Key Data Insights:
1.  Demographics: Ages 20–30 show the highest panic frequency, with women experiencing slightly longer durations.

2. Triggers: Caffeine, PTSD, and stress dominate across age groups, often compounding when therapy is absent.

3. Symptoms: Chest pain and trembling co-occur with elevated heart rates; dizziness is frequent but underreported.

4. Medical History: PTSD and depression drive higher panic scores than anxiety alone.

5.  Lifestyle Impact:

a). Smokers and non-medicated individuals tend to score 2–3 points higher.

b)  Low sleep hours (<5 hrs) strongly correlate with panic severity.

c). Regular therapy lowers panic scores even in high-trigger populations.

d). Physiological Data: Heart rates >140 bpm regularly align with panic scores ≥8.
